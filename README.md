# Ktor_TestBot
A test bot which connects to IRC with Ktor and Coroutines, using Raw Sockets!!!

This bot is a simple exercise in showing how to use Ktor with raw sockets and coroutines. The
BasicConnection class is where all the connecting stuff happens. main.kt is used to implement 
the test bot. The bot connects to Freenode IRC network and joins a channel ##bot-test. To see 
the bot, connect to the network and type "/join ##bot-test". However the bot doest do much.
The port is 6667 and the address, chat.freenode.net.
